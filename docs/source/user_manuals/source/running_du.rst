If |project_name| has been installed using ``sudo make install`` or installed from packages then you will be able to run srsDU from anywhere on your machine. 

If you have built |project_name| from source and have not installed it, then you can run srsDU from: ``/srsRAN_Project/build/apps/du``. In this folder you will find the srsDU application binary. 

Run srsDU as follows, passing the YAML configuration file:  

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo ./srsDU -c du.yml
   
Run srsDU with ``sudo`` to ensure threads are configured with the correct priority. 

Example configuration files can be found in the ``configs/`` folder in |project_name| codebase. For more information on the configuration files and the available parameters see the :ref:`configuration reference <manual_config_ref>`.

When running, srsDU should generate the following console output:

.. code-block:: bash

   Cell pci=1, bw=20 MHz, 1T1R, dl_arfcn=650000 (n78), dl_freq=3750.0 MHz, dl_ssb_arfcn=649632, ul_freq=3750.0 MHz
