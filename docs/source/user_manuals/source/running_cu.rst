If |project_name| has been installed using ``sudo make install`` or installed from packages then you will be able to run srsCU from anywhere on your machine. 

If you have built |project_name| from source and have not installed it, then you can run srsCU from: ``/srsRAN_Project/build/apps/cu``. In this folder you will find the srsCU application binary. 

Run srsCU as follows, passing the YAML configuration file:  

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo ./srsCU -c cu.yml
   
Run srsCU with ``sudo`` to ensure threads are configured with the correct priority. 

Example configuration files can be found in the ``configs/`` folder in |project_name| codebase. For more information on the configuration files and the available parameters see the :ref:`configuration reference <manual_config_ref>`.

When running, srsCU should generate the following console output:

.. code-block:: bash

    N2: Connection to AMF on 127.0.1.100:38412 completed
    F1-C: Listening for new connections on 127.0.10.1:38471...

    ==== CU started ===
    Type <h> to view help   

Configuration parameters can also be passed on the command line. To see the list of options, use: 

.. code-block:: bash

   ./srscu --help
