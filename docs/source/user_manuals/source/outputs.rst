Logs
****

|project_name| provides users with a highly configurable logging mechanism, with per-layer and per-component log levels. Set the log file path and log levels in the gNB config 
file. See the :ref:`Configuration Reference<manual_config_ref>` for more details.

The format used for all log messages is as follows:

    *Timestamp [Layer] [Level] [TTI] message*

Where the fields are:

    * Timestamp in *YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.UUUUUU* format at which log message was generated
    * Layer can be one of *MAC/RLC/PDCP/RRC/SDAP/NGAP/GTPU/RADIO/FAPI/F1U/DU/CU/LIB*. PHY layers are specified as downlink or uplink and with executor number e.g. *DL-PHY1*.
    * Level can be one of *E/W/I/D* for error, warning, info and debug respectively.
    * TTI is only shown for PHY or MAC messages and is in the format *SFN.sn* where SFN is System Frame Number and sn is slot number.

An example log file excerpt can be seen below:

PCAPs
*****

|project_name| can output PCAPs at the following layers: 

  - MAC
  - RLC
  - NGAP
  - N3
  - E1AP
  - F1AP
  - E2AP

To output these PCAPs, they must first be enabled on a per-layer basis in the gNB configuration file. See the :ref:`Configuration Reference<manual_config_ref>` for more details.

MAC
===

To analyze a MAC-layer PCAP using Wireshark, you will need to configure User DLT 149 for UDP and enable the mac_nr_udp protocol:

  #. Go to Edit->Preferences->Protocols->DLT_USER->Edit and add an entry with DLT=149 and Payload protocol=udp.
  #. Go to Edit->Preferences->Protocols->DLT_USER->Edit and add an entry with DLT=157 and Payload protocol=mac-nr-framed.
  #. Go to Analyze->Enabled Protocols->MAC-NR and enable mac_nr_udp
  #. Go to Edit->Preferences->Protocols->MAC-NR: Enable both checkboxes "Attempt to..."; Set LCID->DRB mapping to "From configuration protocol".

.. image:: .imgs/mac_pcap.png

RLC
===

.. note:: 

  To correctly view the RLC PCAPs you will need Wireshark v4.3.x or later. 

To analyze a RLC-layer PCAP using Wireshark, you will need to configure User DLT 149 for UDP and enable the rlc_nr_udp protocol:

  #. Go to Edit->Preferences->Protocols->DLT_USER->Edit and add an entry with DLT=149 and Payload protocol=udp.
  #. Go to Analyze->Enabled Protocols->RLC-NR and enable rlc_nr_udp
  #. Go to Edit->Preferences->Protocols->RLC-NR and configure according to your needs.

.. image:: .imgs/rlc_pcap.png

NGAP
====

To analyze an NGAP-layer PCAP using Wireshark, you will need to configure User DLT 152 for NGAP and enable detection and decoding 5G-EA0 ciphered messages:

  #. Go to Edit->Preferences->Protocols->DLT_USER->Edit and add an entry with DLT=152 and Payload protocol=ngap.
  #. Go to Edit->Preferences->Protocols->NAS-5GS and enable "Try to detect and decode 5G-EA0 ciphered messages".

.. image:: .imgs/ngap_pcap.png

N3
=====

To analyze a N3 PCAP using Wireshark, you will need to configure User DLT 156 for GTP:

  #. Go to Edit->Preferences->Protocols->DLT_USER->Edit and add an entry with DLT=156 and Payload Protocol=gtp.

.. image:: .imgs/gtpu_pcap.png

E1AP
=====

To analyze an E1AP PCAP using Wireshark, you will need to configure User DLT 153 for E1AP:

  #. Go to Edit->Preferences->Protocols->DLT_USER->Edit and add an entry with DLT=153 and Payload Protocol=e1ap.

.. image:: .imgs/e1ap_pcap.png

F1AP
=====

To analyze an F1AP PCAP using Wireshark, you will need to configure User DLT 154 for F1AP:

  #. Go to Edit->Preferences->Protocols->DLT_USER->Edit and add an entry with DLT=154 and Payload Protocol=f1ap.

.. image:: .imgs/f1ap_pcap.png

.. _e2ap_pcap:

E2AP
====

To analyze an E2AP PCAP using Wireshark, you will need to configure User DLT 155 for E2AP:

  #. Go to Edit->Preferences->Protocols->DLT_USER->Edit and add an entry with DLT=155 and Payload Protocol=e2ap.

JSON Metrics
************

|project_name| supports the reporting of the console metrics to a JSON file over UDP socket. This is used to generate the output seen in the :ref:`GrafanaGUI <grafana_gui>`. 

The metrics can be received and written to a file using a Python script. To do this a Python UDP receiver is needed. 

Firstly, the metrics output can be enabled by adding the following to your configuration file: 

.. code-block:: yaml 

  metrics: 
    enable_json_metrics: true

With this enabled, the metrics will be sent to ``127.0.0.1:55555``. The metrics can be written to a file in real-time while the gNB is running using the following Python code: 

.. literalinclude:: .scripts/metrics_udp_receiver.py
  :language: python

This application will need to be run in parallel with the gNB to successfully write the metrics. The metrics will be written to a file called ``gnb_metrics.json``, which will be stored in 
the same location as where the Python application was run. 

You can download the source-code for the above Python application :download:`here <.scripts/metrics_udp_receiver.py>`.
