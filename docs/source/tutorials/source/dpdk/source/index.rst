srsRAN gNB with DPDK
####################

.. note:: 

   This tutorial assumes the machine being used has an Intel processor. For AMD processors some of the commands used will change. The overall steps will remain mostly the same.  

Introduction
************

This tutorial outlines how to configure DPDK for use with the srsRAN CU/DU. 

`DPDK <https://www.dpdk.org/about/>`_, which stands for Data Plane Development Kit, is a set of software libraries and drivers that is used to improve the performance of packet processing in the CU/DU.

Specifically, in the case of the srsRAN CU/DU, this can enable users to achieve higher throughput and a more stable performance with certain configurations. For instance, usecases that require users to 
run an O-RU in a 4x4 MIMO configuration can greatly benefit from using DPDK.

Installing DPDK
***************

.. note::  

   In this tutorial we will use ``vfio-pci`` but you can
   also use ``igb_uio`` or ``uio_pci_generic``. For more information on
   the drivers please refer to `this document <https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/linux_gsg/linux_drivers.html>`_.

As mentioned in the DPDK documentation: 

   *VFIO kernel is usually present by default in all distributions, however please consult your distributions documentation to make sure that is the case.*

   *To make use of full VFIO functionality, both kernel and BIOS must support and be configured to use IO virtualization (such as IntelÂ® VT-d).*

Please make sure that your system meets the above requirements before continuing. In case your system doesn't meet the requirements you can continue with the ``igb_uio`` module, 
as described in the `DPDK documentation <https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/linux_gsg/linux_drivers.html>`_.

First install the following requirements: 

.. code-block:: bash  

   sudo apt install build-essential tar wget python3-pip libnuma-dev meson ninja-build python3-pyelftools

It is recommended to use DPDK 23.11 with srsRAN CU/DU. This can be installed with the 
following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   wget https://fast.dpdk.org/rel/dpdk-23.11.tar.xz
   tar xvf dpdk-23.11.tar.xz dpdk-23.11/
   cd dpdk-23.11/
   meson setup build
   cd build
   ninja
   sudo meson install
   sudo ldconfig

In order to use the ``vfio-pci module``, we need to enable IOMMU in the BIOS. This is usually done by default, but should still be checked.
Furthermore, IOMMU needs to be activated in the kernel. Depending on your CPU, you may need to add ``intel_iommu=on iommu=pt`` for 
Intel CPUs or ``amd_iommu=on iommu=pt`` for AMD CPUs to the ``GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`` line in ``/etc/default/grub``. After this,
update grub and reboot the system:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo update-grub
   sudo reboot

The next step is to ensure the ``vfio-pci`` module is loaded correctly. This can be done with the following command: 

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo modprobe vfio-pci

Verify that ``vfio-pci`` was loaded correctly with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo ./usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -s

You should see an output similar to the following: 

.. code-block:: bash

   Network devices using DPDK-compatible driver
   ============================================

   Network devices using kernel driver
   ===================================
   0000:01:00.0 '82599ES 10-Gigabit SFI/SFP+ Network Connection 10fb' if=enp1s0f0 drv=ixgbe unused=igb_uio,vfio-pci *Active*
   0000:01:00.1 '82599ES 10-Gigabit SFI/SFP+ Network Connection 10fb' if=enp1s0f1 drv=ixgbe unused=igb_uio,vfio-pci *Active*
   0000:05:00.0 'Ethernet Controller E810-XXV for SFP 159b' if=enp5s0f0 drv=ice unused=igb_uio,vfio-pci *Active*
   0000:05:00.1 'Ethernet Controller E810-XXV for SFP 159b' if=enp5s0f1 drv=ice unused=igb_uio,vfio-pci *Active*
   0000:09:00.0 'RTL8125 2.5GbE Controller 8125' if=enp9s0 drv=r8169 unused=igb_uio,vfio-pci

``unused=vfio-pci *Active*`` confirms that the ``vfio_pci`` module was loaded correctly. 


If the ``vfio-pci`` module is not present, it can have multiple issues which are out of scope of this tutorial.
Please refer to your OS maintainer's or CPU vendor's documentation for more information if this is the case. 

You can continue with the ``igb_uio`` module, as described below if necessary.

.. warning:: 

   Only do this if you were unable to correctly load the ``vfio_pci`` module. 

You can install and load ``igb_uio`` with the following commands: 

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone http://dpdk.org/git/dpdk-kmods
   cd dpdk-kmods/linux/igb_uio
   make
   sudo modprobe uio # Ensure uio module is loaded
   sudo insmod igb_uio.ko

Ensure that the module was loaded correctly with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   lsmod | grep uio

You should see an output similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   igb_uio               36864  0
   uio                   24576  1 igb_uio


If the module is not present use ``dmesg`` to check for potential errors:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo dmesg -T

For more information and troubleshooting tips please refer to back to the DPDK documentation and that of your OS maintainers.

Configuring DPDK
****************

Configure Hugepages
===================

DPDK requires ``hugepages`` to be configured to run correctly. The ``dpdk-hugepages.py`` helper script can be used to configure this correctly. We recommend to use 2GB of the 2G hugepages for the
CU/DU running a single sector 4x2 100MHz. If you run more sectors, you will need to increase the amount of hugepages.

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo ./dpdk-hugepages.py -p 1G --setup 2G

To make these changes persistent across boot-cycles, run the following: 

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/huge

Then add the following line at the end of ``/etc/fstab``:

.. code-block:: bash

   nodev /mnt/huge hugetlbfs pagesize=1G 0 0

and edit this line in ``/etc/default/grub``: 

.. code-block:: bash

   GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash intel_iommu=on iommu=pt hugepagesz=1G hugepages=2 default_hugepagesz=1G"

After that, update the grub config and reboot the system:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo update-grub
   sudo reboot

After reboot verify that the hugepages are configured correctly with the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   cat /proc/cmdline
   cat /proc/meminfo

You should see an output similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   cat /proc/cmdline
   
   BOOT_IMAGE=/vmlinuz-5.15.0-1082-realtime root=/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv quiet splash intel_iommu=on iommu=pt hugepagesz=1G hugepages=2 default_hugepagesz=1G

   cat /proc/meminfo
   
   [...]
   HugePages_Total:       8
   HugePages_Free:        8
   HugePages_Rsvd:        0
   HugePages_Surp:        0
   [...]

Once the driver and hugepages are set up successfully the desired interface can then be bound to DPDK. 

Binding to DPDK
===============

We use ``dpdk-devbind.py`` helper script to find interface name and bus ID:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo ./dpdk-devbind.py -s

You should see the following output or similar: 

.. code-block:: bash

   Network devices using kernel driver
   ===================================
   0000:01:00.0 82599ES 10-Gigabit SFI/SFP+ Network Connection 10fb if=enp1s0f0 drv=ixgbe unused=igb_uio,vfio-pci,uio_pci_generic 
   0000:01:00.1 82599ES 10-Gigabit SFI/SFP+ Network Connection 10fb if=enp1s0f1 drv=ixgbe unused=igb_uio,vfio-pci,uio_pci_generic 
   0000:03:00.0 RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller 8168 if=enp3s0 drv=r8169 unused=igb_uio,vfio-pci,uio_pci_generic *Active*

The network card we want to use is ``82599ES 10-Gigabit SFI/SFP+ Network Connection``, port 1. Interface name ``enp1s0f1``, 
bus ID ``0000:01:00.1``. The next step is to bind the desired port to ``vfio-pci``. Some NICs require deactivating 
the interface before binding. Use the following commands to achieve this:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo ifconfig enp1s0f1 down
   sudo ./dpdk-devbind.py --bind vfio-pci 0000:01:00.1

To test that the device has been bound successfully the following command can be used: 

.. code-block:: bash 

   sudo ./dpdk-devbind.py -s

You should see the following output, or similar: 

.. code-block:: bash 

   Network devices using DPDK-compatible driver
   ============================================
   0000:01:00.1 82599ES 10-Gigabit SFI/SFP+ Network Connection 10fb if=enp1s0f1 drv=vfio-pci unused=igb_uio,uio_pci_generic,ixgbe 

If the bind was successful, the output will show ``drv=vfio-pci``. 


EAL Parameters
==============

EAL (Environmental Abstraction Layer) Parameters are used in DPDK to provide a set of functions and abstractions for common environment-related tasks such as memory allocation, thread 
management, and initialization. The DPDK documentation covers EAL parameters `here <https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/linux_gsg/linux_eal_parameters.html>`_. 

In the context of srsRAN we use the ``eal_args`` parameter in the configuration file to instruct DPDK which cores to use for certain processes. If not configured correctly, then the 
CU/DU will not exploit the improvements in performance that comes with using DPDK. This is because DPDK will only see a single core and will not be able to run concurrent processes correctly. 

The EAL parameters, as defined in the above document, are simply passed as as argument to the ``eal_args`` in the CU/DU config. Any of the parameters mentioned in the document can be set in 
this way.

An example configuration is as follows: 

.. code-block:: 

   hal:
      eal_args: "--lcores '(0-1)@(0-23)'"

This will tell DPDK that EAL threads [0 - 1] should use cores [0 - 23]. This is assuming the CU/DU is running on a machine with 24 cores. 

Another example is: 

.. code-block:: 

   hal:
      eal_args: "--lcores (0-1)@(0-23) -a 0000:52:00.0"

This configuration tells DPDK that EAL threads [0 - 1] should use cores [0 - 23] for the device bound to the address [0000:52:00.0].

Running srsRAN with DPDK 
************************

Once DPDK has been installed and configured you will need to create a clean build of |project_name| to enable the use of DPDK. 

If you have not done so already, download the code-base with the following command: 

.. code-block:: bash 

   git clone https://github.com/srsRAN/srsRAN_Project.git

Then build the code-base, making sure to include the correct flags when running cmake: 

.. code-block:: bash 

    cd srsRAN_Project
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DENABLE_DPDK=True -DASSERT_LEVEL=MINIMAL ..
    make -j $(nproc)
    make test -j $(nproc) 

You can now run srsRAN as normal. If everything is running correctly you should see the following console output:

.. code-block:: bash 

   EAL: Detected CPU lcores: 24
   EAL: Detected NUMA nodes: 1
   EAL: Detected shared linkage of DPDK
   EAL: Multi-process socket /var/run/dpdk/rte/mp_socket
   EAL: Selected IOVA mode 'VA'
   EAL: VFIO support initialized
   EAL: Using IOMMU type 1 (Type 1)
   EAL: Probe PCI driver: net_bnxt (14e4:1751) device: 0000:18:00.2 (socket 0)
   TELEMETRY: No legacy callbacks, legacy socket not created
