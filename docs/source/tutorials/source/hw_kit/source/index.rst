Introduction
************

This tutorial provides a detailed guide on setting up an end-to-end O-RAN network for testing, research and development based on the srsRAN CU+DU solution.
A complete set of commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) hardware equipment is proposed, alongside the related software configurations. The proposed solution
targets the following configuration:

  - Single cell split 7.2 deployment.
  - Up to 100 MHz bandwidth.
  - Up to 4T4R with MIMO support.
  - Band N77 (3.3-4.2GHz), N78 (3.3-3.8GHz) or N79 (4.4-5GHz).

This set-up includes hardware components we recommend for a broad range of use cases. However, it is important to note that this configuration may not be the
optimal solution for every scenario. Before investing in any equipment, carefully evaluate the specific needs and requirements of your use case. The srsRAN
project is compatible with x86, ARM, and AMD architectures and has been successfully tested with a wide variety of O-RUs. The equipment outlined here represents
just one of many possible configurations and is provided as a general guide to help users get started with a systems capable of E2E testing in a split 7.2 configuration.

Testbed setup
*************

  :align: center

The proposed test setup implements an end-to-end O-RAN network in a 7.2 split configuration, with the following components:

  - A single compact workstation PC that hosts:

     - CU + DU (srsRAN).
     - 5G core network (e.g., Open5gs).
     - Built-in PTP GM (with optional GPS support).

  - COTS 7.2 O-RU (use of OFH interface and LLS-C1 PTP configuration).

  - COTS 5G UE.

Hardware components
===================

There are many possible hardware options to implement the proposed O-RAN test setup. The sections below outline a complete hardware package that will
enable users to easily deploy a performant end-to-end O-RAN network, with the srsRAN CU+DU at its core.

Workstation PC

O-RU
----

While a wide range of O-RUs are supported by srsRAN, two different options are proposed by taking into account both ease of purchase (low volume)
and the target deployment scenario.
