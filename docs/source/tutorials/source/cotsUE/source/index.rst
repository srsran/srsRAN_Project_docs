srsRAN gNB with COTS UEs
########################

.. warning::
   Operating a private 5G SA network on cellular frequency bands may be tightly regulated in your jurisdiction. Seek the approval of your telecommunications regulator before doing so. 

Overview
********

This tutorial demonstrates how to configure and connect a 5G capable COTS UE to a 5G SA network using |project_name| and a 3rd-party 5G core (Open5GS in this example). 

To connect a COTS UE to a 5G network using |project_name| users will need the following requirements: 
 
    - A PC with a linux based OS 
    - |project_name|  CU/DU
    - RF-frontend compatible with |project_name|
    - A third-party 5G Core 
    - A 5G SA capable COTS UE 
    - A test USIM/ISIM/SIM card (must be a test sim or programmable card with known keys)
    - We also recommend the use of an external clock source such as an octoclock or GPSDO

This specific implementation uses the following: 

    - Dell XPS-13 (Intel i7-10510U CPU) with Ubuntu 20.04
    - |project_name|  CU/DU
    - B210 USRP
    - Open5GS 5G Core 
    - OnePlus 8T
    - SysmoISIM-SJA2 with reprogrammed credentials
    - Leo Bodnar GPS Reference Clock

-----

Setup Considerations
*********************

Open5GS
=======

For this example we are using Open5GS as the 5G Core. 

Open5GS is a C-language Open Source implementation for 5G Core and EPC. The following links will provide you 
with the information needed to download and set-up Open5GS so that it is ready to use with |project_name|: 

    - `GitHub <https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs>`_ 
    - `Quickstart Guide <https://open5gs.org/open5gs/docs/guide/01-quickstart/>`_


COTS UE
=======

You should make sure your device is capable of operating in 5G SA mode and that it operates in the bands supported by |project_name|. 

External Clock
==============

A `Leo Bodnar GPS reference clock <http://www.leobodnar.com/shop/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=107&products_id=234>`_ was used as the USRP clock source for this set-up.

The use of an external clock is not essential, but it mitigates possible errors occurring as result of inaccuracies in the internal clock of the RF front-end being used. The issue comes 
from the CFOs and timings tolerated by 5G handsets - the onboard clocks within SDRs are not always accurate enough to operate within the limits allowed by the handsets. Using an 
external clock, which is much more accurate than an SDR onboard clock, reduces the likelihood that a COTS UE will be unable to see/ connect to the network due to synchronization issues. 

-----


Configuration
*************

The following srsRAN configuration files were modified for this set-up: 

    - :download:`gnb_b210_20MHz_oneplus_8t.yml <.config/gnb_b210_20MHz_oneplus_8t.yml>` 
    
The following Open5GS configuration files were modified for this set-up: 
    
    - :download:`amf.yaml <.config/amf.yaml>` 
    - :download:`upf.yaml <.config/upf.yaml>` 
    - :download:`nrf.yaml <.config/nrf.yaml>` 

The aspects of the network should be configured in the following order: 

    1. gNB
    2. ISIM
    3. Core
    4. COTS UE

gNB
=====

The gNB is configured using the base configuration example found `here <https://github.com/srsran/srsRAN_Project/blob/main/configs/gnb_rf_b200_tdd_n78_20mhz.yml>`_, with some slight modifications. 

The configuration has the following modifications from the original example: 

    - Set the clock source of the USRP to ``internal``. If you are using an external clock source (such as the Leo Bodnar GPSDO) set this to ``external``. 
    - Set the ARFCN of the cell to ``627340``. This ensured the gNB was broadcasting in a free area of spectrum with a BW of 20 MHz in our location.
    - The PLMN is changed to ``90170``. Using the OnePlus 8t, we have found that by forcing a roaming scenario, the phone sees the network and attaches more reliably. A roaming scenario is forced by setting different PLMNs in the cell and the ISIM in the phone.

The above modifications are specific to the set-up being used here. It is recommended to adjust the ARFCN to your local set-up so that you are transmitting in a free area of spectrum. 

To configure the connection between the core and the gNB, you need to set the AMF ``addr`` to the address of the AMF. In this example, the default value is used in the gNB configuration file, and the relevant changes are made in the Open5GS configuration files.

.. note:: 

    |project_name| supports all NR bands up to Rel. 17. Not all BWs are supported in all bands, to confirm that your configuration is correct, you should 
    reference *Table 5.3.5-1* in `TS 38.104 <https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/138100_138199/138104/16.06.00_60/ts_138104v160600p.pdf>`_.

ISIM
=====

SIM Programming
---------------

As outlined previously, this set-up uses the OnePlus 8t, during internal tests it was found that this phone (and other OnePlus devices) sometimes connect to the network more easily in a roaming scenario. This is achieved by setting different PLMNs for the cell and the ISIM in the phone. 

The MMC, MNC, IMSI and other credentials in the ISIM can be set by reprogramming. We reprogrammed our SysmoISIM-SJA2 using the following steps. 

Download `pySim <https://github.com/osmocom/pysim>`_ : 

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/osmocom/pysim
    cd pysim
    sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends \
    	pcscd libpcsclite-dev \
    	python3 \
    	python3-setuptools \
    	python3-pyscard \
    	python3-pip
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

You can then run the following commands from within the ``pysim`` directory. 

Check the current ISIM configuration: 

.. code-block:: bash

    ./pySim-read.py -p0

Reconfigure the ISIM: 

.. code-block:: bash

   ./pySim-prog.py -p0 -s <ICCID> --mcc=<MCC> --mnc=<MNC> -a <ADM-KEY> --imsi=<IMSI> -k <KI> --opc=<OPC> 

You need to at least set the PLMN to 00101, optionally you can also reconfigure other aspects of the ISIM. For this set-up the following command was used: 

.. code-block:: bash

   ./pySim-prog.py -p0 -s 8988211000000689615 --mcc=001 --mnc=01 -a 77190612 --imsi=001010123456789  -k 41B7157E3337F0ADD8DA89210D89E17F --opc=1CD638FC96E02EBD35AA0D41EB6F812F 

.. note::
   You will need to get the ICCID, ADM-KEY and other security information from the SIM provider.

SUCI Configuration
------------------

If you are using a sysmoISIM-SJA2 ISIM (5G-enabled) as in this example, then you will need to modify the 5G-related fields of the sim card. In particular you need to configure or disable SUPI concealment (SUCI).

SUPI concealment can be disabled using the following commands. You should replace ``<ADM-KEY>`` with the ADM key of the respective SIM card. 

.. note::
   ``verify_adm`` does not print any output on success. If you see something like `"SW Mismatch: Expected 9000 and got 6982"` the ADM key is not correct. Keep in mind that after 
   3 failed write attempts due to a wrong ADM key the SIM is blocked and cannot be rewritten again.

.. code-block:: bash

    pySIM-shell (MF)> select MF
    pySIM-shell (MF)> select ADF.USIM
    pySIM-shell (MF/ADF.USIM)> select EF.UST
    pySIM-shell (MF)> verify_adm <ADM-KEY>
    pySIM-shell (MF/ADF.USIM/EF.UST)> ust_service_deactivate 124
    pySIM-shell (MF/ADF.USIM/EF.UST)> ust_service_deactivate 125

After these steps **UST service 124** and **125** should be disabled. You can verify the ISIM configuration using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./pySim-read.py -p0

More information on pySim and SUCI configuration can be found in `this guide <https://downloads.osmocom.org/docs/pysim/master/html/suci-tutorial.html>`_ in the pySim documentation. 

.. _open5gs: 

Open5GS
=======

For this set-up Open5GS is running as a service on the machine, this is the "default" way of running Open5GS as described in their documentation. If you are running open5GS in a docker container, or other environment, your configuration will vary slightly. 

The Open5GS `5G Core Quickstart Guide <https://open5gs.org/open5gs/docs/guide/01-quickstart/#:~:text=restart%20open5gs%2Dsgwud-,Setup%20a%205G%20Core,-You%20will%20need>`_ provides a comprehensive overview of how to configure Open5GS to run as a 5G Core. 

To configure the core correctly the following steps need to be taken: 

    - Configure the core to connect to the gNB.
    - Configure the PLMN and TAC values so that they are the same as those present in the gNB configuration.
    - Register the ISIM credentials to the list of subscribers through the Open5GS WebUI.

amf.yml
-------

In the AMF configuration file the following modifications need to be made: 

    - Set the NGAP addr, this should be the same as the AMF addr as seen in the gNB configuration file
    - Set the MCC, MNC and TAC values such that they are the same as the PLMN and TAC used in the gNB configuration file, and different to that of the ISIM

.. code-block:: diff

        ngap:
    -      - addr: 127.0.0.5
    +      - addr: 127.0.1.100

    +          mnc: 70

    
upf.yml
-------

In the UPF configuration file the following modifications need to be made: 

    - Set the GTPU addr, this should be the same as the AMF addr as seen in the gNB configuration file

.. code-block:: diff

        upf:
         pfcp:
           - addr: 127.0.0.7
         gtpu:
    -      - addr: 127.0.0.7     
    +      - addr: 127.0.1.100
         subnet:
           - addr: 10.45.0.1/16
           - addr: 2001:db8:cafe::1/48
         metrics:
           - addr: 127.0.0.7
             port: 9090

nrf.yml
-------

In the NRF configuration, the following modifications need to be made: 

    - Set the PLMN to match that of the gNB and AMF configuration files
    - Set the address of the AMF to match that of the gNB configuration file

.. code-block:: yml 

    logger:
      file:

      sbi:
        server:
          - address: 127.0.0.10
            port: 7777    

User Database
-------------

You can see how to register subscriber information with the core `here <https://open5gs.org/open5gs/docs/guide/01-quickstart/#:~:text=Register%20Subscriber%20Information>`_. 

You will need to at least fill the IMSI, AMF, K and OPc related to the subscriber, as well as the APN.

.. note::
   Set the APN to IPv4, not IPv4/6 or IPv6. 

COTS UE
=======

To configure the OnePlus 8t to connect to the network the following steps must be taken: 

    1. Enable the ISIM
    2. Enable 5G SA Mode
    3. Enable data roaming 
    4. Disable VoLTE and/or VoNR 
    5. Configure the APN
    6. Force NR only

Enable ISIM, 5G and data roaming
--------------------------------

The first step in configuring the UE is to make sure the SIM and the use of a 5G NR carrier is enabled. In this example the ISIM is placed in SIM tray 1, and there is no other SIM present. 

In the first image, you can see that the ISIM is correctly found, and that mobile data is enabled. In the second image you can see that the ISIM is enabled, data roaming is enabled and that 5G is set as the preferred network type. 

|sim1| |sim2|

   .. |sim1| image:: .imgs/sim_1.jpg
      :width: 20% 

   .. |sim2| image:: .imgs/sim_2.jpg
      :width: 20% 

If you cannot see the ``5G`` option in ``Preferred network type``, then you may need to activate it. This can be enabled under the Developer Options, if you do not have access to Developer Options see `this guide <https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options>`_. 
In ``Developer Options`` go to ``Networking`` and enable ``5G``, you may also need to set ``5G network mode`` to ``NSA + SA Mode``

The final option that needs to be enabled here is ``data roaming``, this is shown in the second image. 

In some phones there may also be an option to configure ``VoNR`` and/or ``VoLTE``, it is important to make sure that this is **disabled**.  

Configure APN
-------------

|apn1| |apn2|

   .. |apn1| image:: .imgs/apn_1.jpg
      :width: 20% 

   .. |apn2| image:: .imgs/apn_2.jpg
      :width: 20% 

The above images show the APN configuration used in this example. The key points to note are the following: 

    - The APN ``Name`` is arbitrary, and can have any string value.
    - The ``APN`` option needs to be set to the same as the ``DNN/APN`` option as set in the Open5GS subscriber registration.
    - The ``APN protocol`` and ``APN roaming protocol`` are both set to **IPv4** as in the Open5GS subscriber registration. Setting to IPv6 or IPv4/6 can lead to issues connecting the internet. 
    - All other options are left to the default values.

Force NR
--------

The application ``5G Switch - Force 5G Only`` can be used to force your device to only see 5G NR networks. This works with devices that are not rooted, and was used as part of this setup to ensure 
the device could see and attach to the network. Although it was not a requirement to get the phone to connect it made it easier to consistently connect to the network.

The apps Play Store page looks like the following: 

   .. image:: .imgs/app.jpg
      :width: 20%

When you run the app you can select ``NR Only`` from the ``Set Preferred Network Type`` menu. This looks like the following:  

   .. image:: .imgs/force_nr.jpg
      :width: 20%

When you select this option, you may see the ``Preferred Network Type`` field in the SIM configuration menu change to ``4G/3G/2G (Auto)`` as seen in the screenshot in the :ref:`Connecting to the Network section <connect>`. 
This is fine, and can be ignored. Once NR is selected in the app, you do not have to select 5G from the SIM configuration menu. 

Connecting the COTS UE
**********************

To connect the COTS UE to the network the following steps must be taken once the phone and network have been correctly configured: 

    1. Run the gNB and ensure it is correctly connected to the core 
    2. Search for the network from the UE
    3. Select and connect to the network 
    4. Verify the attach
    5. Stream data 

Setting-up the Network
======================

Check that the Core is running correctly 
-----------------------------------------

First it is good to check that Open5GS is running correctly, this can be done with the following command: 

.. code-block:: bash

    ps aux | grep open5gs

If the core is running correctly the following should be given as the output: 

.. code-block:: bash

In total there should be 16 processes running.  

Once the core is running it is helpful to view the AMF logs for the duration of testing. This makes is clear when the gNB attaches, and when the COTS UE successfully attaches to the network. 

To view this you can run this command: 

.. code-block:: bash

    tail -f /var/log/open5gs/amf.log

You should see an output similar to the following: 

.. code-block:: bash

Run the gNB
-----------

To run the gNB using the configuration file above, navigate to ``srsRAN_Project/build/apps/gnb`` and use the following command: 

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo ./gnb -c gnb_b210_20MHz_oneplus_8t.yml

This above command assumes the configuration file is located in the same folder. 

Once the gNB is running you should see the following output: 

.. code-block:: bash

If the connection to the core is successful you should see the following from the AMF log: 

.. code-block:: bash

    04/03 13:25:13.469: [amf] INFO: gNB-N2 accepted[127.0.0.1]:47633 in ng-path module (../src/amf/ngap-sctp.c:113)

.. _connect: 

Connecting to the Network
========================= 

The COTS UE can now search for the network. To do this, navigate to *Mobile Network > SIM 1 > Carrier* and search for the network. 

When you enter the *Carrier* menu your device may automatically search for available carriers, if not you can manually select the search option from the top right of the screen. 

If the device can successfully receive SIBs (specifically SIB1) and "see" the network it will appear of the list of available carriers. It will be displayed as ``Open5GS 5G`` or ``90170 5G``. If your PLMN is something else it may be displayed as ``[PLMN] 5G``.

The following image shows what this may look like: 

.. image:: .imgs/sim_connect.jpg
    :width: 20%
   
Select the carrier for the network, in this instance ``Open5GS 5G``, the UE should then attach to the network. 

To confirm the attach is successful you can monitor both the AMF log and gNB console output. 

The AMF log should look similar to the following:

Troubleshooting
***************

Network Not Visible
===================

- If you are not using a GPSDO or other external clock, you may need to use one. As explained previously, the onboard clocks within SDRs are not always accurate enough to operate within the limits allowed by the handsets. 

- For this device, the ISIM needed to be in SIM tray 2. If your device is dual SIM capable and you cannot see the network, try placing the ISIM in the other slot.

- If you were previously able to see the network, but now cannot, you should eject the ISIM and insert it again. The device may be blacklisting the gNB if the device has previously tried to connect and failed. 

- You should check that the gNB is transmitting correctly. This can be done with a spectrum analyzer or tools like `gr-fosphor <https://kb.ettus.com/Fosphor>`_ and `Maia SDR <https://maia-sdr.org/>`_. An example of a "healthy" gNB broadcast from Maia SDR can be seen here:

   .. image:: .imgs/maia_sdr.png
      :scale: 50% 


Unable to Attach
================

If you can see the network, but cannot attach, here are some things to test: 

  - Check that the subscriber has been added correctly to the Open5GS list of users. If you did not restart the Open5Gs services after making modifications, then do so and retry connecting the UE. Open5GS does not support on-the-fly modifications to subscribers or config files. 


  - The device may not be able to PRACH. If you are using NSG, then you will be able to see the control messages being exchanged between the UE and the gNB, check this to see whether or not the PRACH was successful. If not, here are a list of things to check:  
  
    - The signal quality (use Maia SDR, Fosphor or some other tool); you can adjust the Tx and Rx gains to compensate for this. If there are any commercial cells broadcasting in the same area of spectrum this could also be causing RF issues. 
    - Timing issues; if there are discrepencies in timing then the UE will not be able to connect. Use an external clock to overcome this. 



No Internet Access
==================

If your device is connected to the network but cannot access the internet it is most likely an issue with the APN configuration. Make sure that the credentials and info are the same across both the UE and the APN configuration in the Core. The main things to check are: 

    - The APN should have the same ID in both the phone and core
    - Set the protocol to IPv4
    - Make sure VoNR/ VoLTE is disabled on the UE 
    - Restart all Open5GS services and try again



UE Disconnects after a few Minutes
==================================

Some Android smartphones silently drop the network connection if IMS is not configured within a couple of minutes after attach. We confirmed this behavior with Google Pixel 6 having a timeout of 180s (3 minutes), but it may apply to other devices and vendors as well.

A possible solution without the need to configure IMS is to either set an infinite timeout or disable the feature in smartphone. For this purpose, open a hidden IMS settings menu by dialing ``*#*#0702#*#*``, then change one of the two following settings:

    - Infinite timeout: Set ``NR_TIMER_WAIT_IMS_REGISTRATION`` from default ``180`` to ``-1``
    - Disable timeout: Set ``SUPPORT_IMS_NR_REGISTRATION_TIMER`` from default ``1`` to ``0``

Examples:

   .. image:: .imgs/nr_timer_wait_ims_registration.png
      :scale: 50% 

   .. image:: .imgs/support_ims_nr_registration_timer.png
      :scale: 50% 

The smartphone stores these setting persistently across reboots on a per-IMSI basis, i.e. if you change the SIM the UE remembers the settings for each SIM separately.
