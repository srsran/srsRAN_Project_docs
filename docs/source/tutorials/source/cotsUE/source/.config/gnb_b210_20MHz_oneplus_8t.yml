# This configuration file example shows how to configure the srsRAN Project gNB to connect to a COTS UE. As with the 
# associated tutorial, this config has been tested with a OnePlus 8T. A B210 USRP is used as the RF-frontend.   
# This config creates a TDD cell with 20 MHz bandwidth in band 78. 
# To run the srsRAN Project gNB with this config, use the following command: 
#   sudo ./gnb -c gnb_b210_20MHz_oneplus_8t.yaml
