MATLAB Testing Tools
####################

Overview
************

This tutorial explains the main features of `srsRAN-matlab <https://github.com/srsran/srsRAN_matlab>`_, a MATLAB-based project for testing
|project_name|. More specifically, this tutorial will show how to generate a new set of test vectors for the srsRAN
Project tests, how to analyze the uplink IQ samples recorded by srsRAN gNB, and how to run end-to-end,
link-level simulations for testing PHY components of |project_name|. This will be done across three independent sections.

srsRAN-matlab offers three main tools: the test vector generators, the uplink analyzers and the link-level simulators.

Test Vector Generation
======================

Test vectors are mainly used to test, develop and debug the PHY components of |project_name|. This tutorial will show
how to generate the set of vectors used for unit testing inside the srsRAN repository. As well as outlining how to generate a
new set of random vectors for broadening the extent of the tests.

Signal Analyzers
================

The signal analyzers are useful for testing the uplink chain of the gNB. Specifically, they provide visual hints about the
signal quality in the uplink slots.

Simulators
==========

The simulators can be used to estimate the performance of the PHY uplink channels under different configurations and channel
conditions provided by MATLAB's 3GPP-compliant models.

Set-Up Considerations
*********************

For this application note, the following hardware and software are used:

- A PC with Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS
- `srsRAN-matlab <https://github.com/srsran/srsRAN_matlab>`_
- `srsRAN Project <https://github.com/srsran/srsRAN_project>`_
- MathWorks `MATLAB <https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html>`_ (R2022b or R2023a) with the `5G Toolbox <https://www.mathworks.com/products/5g.html?s_tid=srchtitle_site_search_1_5g%20toolbox>`_

.. note::

   Running the srsRAN-matlab testing suite requires a working copy of MATLAB and its 5G Toolbox

Installation
************

Assuming that |project_name| and MATLAB have both been downloaded and installed, the next step is to download srsRAN-matlab.

This can be done with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/srsran/srsRAN_matlab.git

.. note::

   This tutorial assumes that |project_name| is installed in the users come directory.

Once it has been downloaded, the working directory for srsRAN-matlab should be added to MATLAB's search path. This can be done from the MATLAB console with the following command:

.. code-block:: matlab

   cd ~/srsRAN_matlab
   addpath .

To verify you have added srsRAN-matlab successfully to MATLAB's search path, run the following command (again from the MATLAB console):

.. code-block:: matlab

   runtests('unitTests', Tag='matlab code')

If successful, the following output should be shown at the end of the console output:

.. code-block:: matlab

   ans =

     1x94 TestResult array with properties:

       Name
       Passed
       Failed
       Incomplete
       Duration
       Details

   Totals:
      94 Passed, 0 Failed, 0 Incomplete.
      42.2176 seconds testing time.
