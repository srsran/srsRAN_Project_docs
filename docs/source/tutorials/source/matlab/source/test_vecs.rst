The PHY components of |project_name| are tested by feeding each component with vectors of input data and
comparing the resulting output with their expected values. In |project_name|, the test vectors for a
PHY component usually consist of a number of binary files with input and output data, and a single shared header file 
that describes the test set-up and the content of the binary files. The binary files are packed in a single tarball.
For example, the test vectors of the channel estimator are provided by the files ``port_channel_estimator_test_data.h`` and
``port_channel_estimator_test_data.tar.gz`` in ``~/srsRAN_Project/tests/unittests/phy/upper/signal_processors``. 

The files ``srs<ComponentName>Unittest.m`` in the main directory of ``srsRAN-matlab`` provide the classes for
generating such PHY input-output test vectors. This is done by leveraging MATLAB 5G Toolbox. These classes inherit from
the MATLAB ``matlab.unittest.TestCase`` class, meaning all of the tools within MATLAB's unit
testing framework can be used with them. To facilitate the generation of test vectors, a simplified interface
is provided with srsRAN-matlab. 

To generate the test vectors for all PHY components the following code needs to be run from the MATLAB console: 

.. code-block:: matlab

   runSRSRANUnittest('all', 'testvector')

This will generate a ``.h`` and ``.tar.gz`` file for each of the PHY components and place them in the folder ``~/srsRAN_matlab/testvector_outputs``.. 

The test vectors for a single PHY component can also be generated. This is done by replacing ``all`` with the name of the desired
component, as per its declaration in ``~/srsRAN_Project/include/srsran/``. For example, the test vectors for the channel estimator, 
whose interface is declared in ``~/srsRAN_Project/include/srsran/phy/upper/signal_processors/port_channel_estimator.h``, can be
generated with the following command: 

.. code-block:: matlab 

   runSRSRANUnittest('port_channel_estimator', 'testvector')

Once the test vectors have been generated, the pairs of ``.h`` and ``tar.gz`` files in the ``testvector_outputs`` folder
can be transferred to |project_name| folder with the MATLAB command:

.. code-block:: matlab

   srsTest.copySRStestvectors('testvector_outputs', '~/srsRAN_Project/')

This command will automatically copy all test vectors to the proper subdirectory inside ``~/srsRAN_Project/tests/unittests/phy``. 

By default, executing ``runSRSRANUnittest`` will reproduce the same test vectors as the ones provided with
|project_name| repository. To generate a random set of vectors, we simply need to add the ``RandomShuffle``
option. This can be done with the following command: 

.. code-block:: matlab

   runSRSRANUnittest('all', 'testvector', RandomShuffle=true)
