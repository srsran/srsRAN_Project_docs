# This configuration file example shows how to configure the srsRAN Project gNB to allow AmariUE to connect to it. 
# This specific example uses ZMQ in place of a physical RF-frontend, and creates an FDD cell with 10 MHz bandwidth in band 7. 
# To run the srsRAN Project gNB with this config, use the following command: 
#   sudo ./gnb -c gnb_zmq_b210_fdd_n7_10mhz.yaml
