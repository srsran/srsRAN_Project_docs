Code Style Guide
################

This document establishes the basic guidelines and recommendations for C and C++ programming styles within |project_name| code base. Many of the guidelines are C++ specific, however
some can still be applied to C. The main goal of this document is to help establish a consistent programming style throughout |project_name| code base, and 
improve the readability and maintainability of code committed by users. 

This document is heavily inspired in `LLVM's coding standards <https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html>`_, please refer to this
if you would like to take a further look into coding standards and best practices.
